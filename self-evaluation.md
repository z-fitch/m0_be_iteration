# Self Evaluation

How might the `each` method be useful?
It would be useful if you need to run a bunch of array elements through certain statements to check them, it would help you not have to type out each one.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
I still need to practice formatting, I keep missing small things.
- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment? The practice with this one really helped, the more practice I got the easier it was for me. I think if there are fewer practices I'll probably start doing them multiple times
